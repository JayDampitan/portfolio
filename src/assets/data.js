      "Coming out of the Bitwise Industry classes, Reactoad Movie App is aIMDB clone and my first project coming  in the Bitwise apprenticeship program. In collaboration with my teammates  Danny Sanchez and Elias Guttierez, our first challenge as apprentices  was to fetch data from a movie API and create an application utilizing the data that have been fetched. This presented a great challenge on my part since this is my first exposure to APIâ€™s and how to fetch data from them. But with great guidance from our lead Kendrick Mausolf, and amazing team work, we have achieved our first challenge and created this application that you see today. ",

Also introducing new technologies such Redux and Redux Toolkit. With the help of my teammates Kenneth Ferrell II and Paul Gonzalez. We created a fan game where users can buy Pokemons with the initial Poke dollars we give them and play on our integrated poke slot machine where you can win a Pokemon on every spin for a chance to collect them all. Also included in the app is a feature where you can collect different badges by collecting certain Pokemons. ",

The challenge that was presented to us is the first exposure to React Native and RTK query, a feature of Redux Toolkit to fetch data from APIs. Although the transition from React to React Native was quite easy, the integration of styled components with React Native presented a challenge and prevented us from creating a neumorphic design to our application. Thanks to my teammates Connie Lai and Elias Gutierrez, we still came up with a simple yet modern approach to our design.",

      "Hello my name is Jay Dampitan, I am 37 years old and  currently a React apprentice at Bitwise Industries based in Fresno, California. My passion for learning and natural curiosity led to Bitwise where my coding journey started. Prior to programming, I worked in the casino industry for over 16 years where I learned many disciplines that helped me in my career. As a clerk I learned communication skills with clients and associates. I learned leadership and decision making skills as a floor supervisor for over a decade and efficiency as an accounting audit clerk and consistency as an anti money laundering compliance officer. My enthusiasm for learning has led me to many hobbies, interests, areas of study and career paths. It led me to programming, my chosen career. My journey on this one is still somewhat new, but I cannot be more excited to learn more about the tech industry."
